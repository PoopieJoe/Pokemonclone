Priority:
- Team builder/editor
- Team viewer/picker

Other:
- Implement instant attack effects (can I even do animations?)
- Predictive damage calc
- Advanced string processing (e.g. colors, italics, bold, different fonts, etc.)
- Make some proper goddamn comments, especially for the ui and class methods, they're a mess
