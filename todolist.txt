Priority:
- Handle attack targeting & multitargeting
- Fill database (~20 species, ~30 equipment pieces, ~50 attacks)
- Victory screen
- Title screen

Other:
- Implement instant attack effects (can you even do animations?)
- implement equipment and attacks flag functionality
- Advanced string processing (e.g. colors, italics, bold, different fonts, etc.)
- Make some proper goddamn comments, especially for the ui and class methods, they're a mess
